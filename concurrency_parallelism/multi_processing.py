Important:
Install psutil module
"pip install psutil"

Multiprocessing allows a program to run tasks in parallel 
across multiple CPU cores. This is beneficial for CPU-bound tasks, 
such as heavy mathematical computations or image processing. 
Each process runs independently, with its own memory space, 
avoiding the limitations of Pythonâ€™s GIL.

In an operating system, multiprocessing leverages multiple cores 
of the CPU, each executing a task in parallel. It is ideal for tasks 
that need maximum computational power.

This is the crucial part. When multiprocessing is used on Windows, 
it needs to know which code to execute as the "main" program. 
If this guard is not in place, it tries to re-import the script,
