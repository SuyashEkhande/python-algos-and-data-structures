# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository provides Python implementations of various data structures, algorithms, design patterns, and solutions to popular coding problems. It aims to build a strong foundation in Python programming, improve problem-solving skills, and explore optimization techniques for real-world and competitive programming challenges on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. **fundamentals**
This folder contains basic Python concepts and fundamental programming techniques to build a strong foundation.

- Built-in functions and modules
- Closures, nested functions, and decorators
- Context managers and file handling
- Python data structures, comprehensions, and string operations
- Functions, control flow, and operators
- Module imports and custom modules

### 2. **object_oriented_programming**
This folder focuses on object-oriented programming concepts and patterns.

- Classes, objects, and inheritance
- Encapsulation and polymorphism
- Static and class methods
- Dunder (magic) methods

### 3. **algorithms**
This folder includes implementations of essential algorithms, covering:

- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)

### 4. **dsa**
This folder includes implementations of core data structures and algorithms for DSA practice.

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees
- Graphs

### 5. **design_patterns**
This folder organizes design patterns into three categories:

#### Creational Patterns
- Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory, Prototype, Singleton

#### Structural Patterns
- Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy

#### Behavioral Patterns
- Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template, Visitor

### 6. **concurrency_parallelism**
This folder demonstrates concurrency and parallelism concepts in Python.

- Asynchronous Programming (`asyncio`)
- Threading (`py_threading.py`)
- Multiprocessing (`multi_processing.py`)
- Using `concurrent.futures` for thread and process pools
- Green threads with `gevent`

### 7. **memory_management**
This folder explores memory management and optimization techniques in Python.

- Garbage collection
- Heap and stack memory differentiation
- Memory usage optimization
- Weak references

### 8. **problems**
This folder contains solutions to coding problems from platforms such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank.

### 9. **testing_debugging**
This folder focuses on testing and debugging techniques in Python.

#### Debugging
- Examples using Python's `pdb` debugger

#### Profiling and Optimization
- Code profiling with `cProfile`
- Optimization using `functools.lru_cache`
- Benchmarking with `timeit`

#### Unit Testing
- Example unit tests for mathematical operations
