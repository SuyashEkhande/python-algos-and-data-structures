# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures, algorithms, and solutions to popular coding problems. The goal is to practice and understand key concepts of Python, Data Structures, and Algorithms, along with solutions to common problems on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces.

## Repository Structure

The repo is organized into the following folders:

### 1. **python_basics**
This folder contains basic Python concepts and fundamental programming techniques to build a strong foundation in Python programming.

- Variables, Data types
- Control Flow (if, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- File handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

### 2. **data_structures**
This folder contains implementations of core data structures commonly used in algorithms.

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables (Dictionaries)
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix)

### 3. **algorithms**
This folder includes implementations of essential algorithms, including sorting and searching algorithms, and other important algorithms used in competitive programming.

- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)

### 4. **problems_solutions**
This folder contains solutions to coding problems from platforms such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank.

- LeetCode
- Codeforces
- HackerRank

### 5. **tests**
This folder contains test cases for verifying the correctness of implementations.

- Unit tests for individual data structures and algorithms.
- Problem-specific tests for solutions.
