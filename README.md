# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures, algorithms, and solutions to popular coding problems. The goal is to practice and understand key concepts of Python, Data Structures, and Algorithms, along with solutions to common problems on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces.

## Repository Structure

The repo is organized into the following folders:

### 1. **algorithms**
This folder includes implementations of essential algorithms, including sorting and searching algorithms, and other important algorithms used in competitive programming.

- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)

### 2. **concurrency_parallelism**
This folder contains implementations and examples of concurrency and parallelism concepts in Python.

- Threading
- Multiprocessing
- Asynchronous Programming (asyncio)

### 3. **dsa**
This folder includes implementations of core data structures and algorithms for DSA practice.

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees
- Graphs

### 4. **fundamentals**
This folder contains basic Python concepts and fundamental programming techniques to build a strong foundation in Python programming.

- Variables, Data types
- Control Flow (if, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- File handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

### 5. **object_oriented_programming**
This folder focuses on object-oriented programming concepts and patterns.
